Example code for "RTOS" lab 
in CPE-312, Thai-Nichi Institute of Technology

The RTOS_template project is a simple RTX Kernel based example for 
the ST 'STM32L152RB' microcontroller using ST 'STM32L-Discovery' 
Evaluation Board, compliant to Cortex Microcontroller 
Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - SYSCLK  =           16.00 MHz (HSI)
   - HCLK    = SYSCLK  = 16.00 MHz

The simple RTX Kernel based example uses two RTX tasks
to turn on and off LED.


The example program is available in different targets:

  STM32L152 Flash:    configured for on-chip Flash
                      (used for production or target debugging)

  STM32L152 RAM:      configured for on-chip RAM
                      (used for target debugging)
